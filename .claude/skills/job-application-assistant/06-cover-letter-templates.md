# Cover Letter Templates and Tailoring Guide

## Template: Custom cover.cls (XeLaTeX)

Cover letters use a custom LaTeX document class (`cover.cls`) with Lato/Raleway fonts.

**Output file:** `cover_letters/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
**Compile with:** XeLaTeX (cover.cls requires fontspec)
**Font directory:** `cover_letters/OpenFonts/fonts/`

### Compile command

```bash
cd cover_letters && xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode cover_<company>_<role>.tex
```

Expected output: `Output written on cover_<company>_<role>.pdf (1 page, ...)`. Any page count other than 1 is a failure that must be fixed before presenting to the user.

## Compile-and-Inspect Loop (MANDATORY)

After writing the cover letter and before presenting to the user, always compile and visually inspect the PDF. Iterate until the layout is clean:

1. Run `xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
2. Confirm page count is exactly 1 and compile succeeded
3. Read the PDF via the Read tool and visually check: signature fits at the bottom, no text cut off, bullet font matches body

### Known template pitfall: itemize inside `\lettercontent{}`

The `\lettercontent{}` macro appends `\\` to its argument. This breaks when the argument ends in `\end{itemize}` because `\\` has no line to break after the environment closes, producing `! LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end.` and no PDF output.

**Wrong (breaks compile):**
```latex
\lettercontent{Here is how my experience maps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}}
```

**Correct — close `\lettercontent{}` before the list and wrap the list in the matching Raleway-Medium font so typography stays consistent:**
```latex
\lettercontent{Here is how my experience maps:}

{\raggedright\fontspec[Path = OpenFonts/fonts/raleway/]{Raleway-Medium}\fontsize{11pt}{13pt}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}\par}
\vspace{6pt}

\lettercontent{[next paragraph]}
```

The font wrapper is mandatory — if you just move `\begin{itemize}` outside `\lettercontent{}` without the `\fontspec` block, bullets render in the default body font (Lato) and visually mismatch the rest of the letter.

## Document Structure

```latex
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Cover Letter - [Company], [Role]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass[]{cover}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}

\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}

\rfoot{Page \thepage \hspace{0pt}}
\thispagestyle{empty}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\begin{document}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     TITLE NAME
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\namesection{}{\Huge{[YOUR_NAME]}}{  \href{mailto:[YOUR_EMAIL]}{[YOUR_EMAIL]} | [YOUR_PHONE] |  \urlstyle{same}\href{[YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL]}{LinkedIn}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     MAIN COVER LETTER CONTENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\currentdate{\today}
\lettercontent{Dear [Name/Team],}

\lettercontent{[Opening paragraph - role, connection to background, 2-3 sentences]}

\lettercontent{[Body paragraph - most relevant experience, introducing the bullet list]}

{\raggedright\fontspec[Path = OpenFonts/fonts/raleway/]{Raleway-Medium}\fontsize{11pt}{13pt}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Concrete achievement/skill 1]
    \item [Concrete achievement/skill 2]
    \item [Concrete achievement/skill 3]
\end{itemize}\par}

\lettercontent{[Connection to company - why this role, why this company specifically]}

\lettercontent{[Personal fit paragraph - behavioral strengths, team contribution, 2-3 sentences]}

\lettercontent{I look forward to hearing from you.}

\begin{flushright}
% No trailing \\ inside \closing{} - cover.cls appends its own \\, and a
% doubled break triggers "! LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end."
\closing{Kind regards,}

\signature{[YOUR_NAME]}
\end{flushright}
\end{document}
```

## Key Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `\namesection{}{Name}{contact info}` | Header with name and contact |
| `\currentdate{date}` | Date field (use `\today` or explicit date) |
| `\lettercontent{text}` | Body paragraph (adds spacing after) |
| `\closing{text}` | Closing line |
| `\signature{name}` | Printed name below signature |

## Reusable Paragraph Modules (from master cover letter)

Extracted from `documents/cv/master_cover_letter.md` by `/setup` Path A. These are **phrasing references, never fact sources** - like the `05-cv-templates.md` profile statements, every factual claim still comes from `01-candidate-profile.md` before drafting. Swap the relevant module in for the body paragraph that introduces the bullet list (Paragraph 4 in the Document Structure template above), in the same first-person, non-contracted voice, then trim elsewhere to stay inside the 250-300 word budget.

**Module A - CTO / VP of Engineering:**
> I lead engineering the way I lead everything: with an operator's discipline. At Blue Ocean I reported directly to the CEO, ran a nine-person technology organization, and project-managed the initiatives that could not fail - a matching engine migration to MEMX, a clearing transition from Velox to RQD, and the stand-up of a fully redundant disaster recovery site. I built the Agile practice from scratch and owned uptime, security, and regulatory technology obligations end to end. Small teams can run big platforms when the systems, the priorities, and the people are right.

**Module B - VP of Data & Analytics / BI Delivery:**
> Data is where I started and where I still do my best work. I architected a firm-wide time-series repository for fixed income trading at Wells Fargo; built four data repositories and more than twenty-two executive dashboards for Cancer Treatment Centers of America; grew a one-person analytics function into an eight-person data organization with P&L ownership at IMS; and delivered John Deere's first enterprise data mart. I know what it takes to make data governed, trusted, and - hardest of all - actually adopted.

**Module C - AI Strategy / AI Leadership:**
> I pair a formal machine learning education with production reality. I have shipped models that did real work - a neural network mapping charts of accounts across client datasets, renewal-probability models at John Deere - and at Blue Ocean I established the AI governance policies that let a regulated trading venue adopt ChatGPT and Claude Code responsibly. I treat AI as an executive discipline: use-case selection, governance, data readiness, and change management. The models are the easy part.

**Module D - Capital Markets / FinTech:**
> I know regulated markets from the inside: SEC registration and Reg SCI readiness, FINRA reporting, Fair Access, matching engine migrations, clearing transitions, corporate actions, FIX connectivity, and trade surveillance. I have built and operated the technology behind a live national market - and I understand the difference between software that works and software that withstands a regulator's audit.

## Tailoring Guidelines

### Salutation
- If you know the hiring manager's name: "Dear [First Last],"
- If you know the team: "Dear [Company] hiring team,"
- Generic: "Dear [Company]," (avoid "To whom it may concern")

### Length - Hard 1-Page Limit
- Target: 1 page including signature block
- Maximum: **never exceed 1 page**
- **Word budget: 250-300 words** of body text (not counting LaTeX markup). This is the safe maximum. 350 words will overflow.
- **Always count**: opening paragraph + bullet list paragraph + closing paragraph = 3 blocks. Add a 4th only if the others are short.
- When adding company-specific content, trim other content to compensate rather than adding net length

### Line Spacing
- Add `\usepackage{setspace}` and `\setstretch{1.0}` if the letter is long and needs to fit on one page
- Use `\vspace{.5cm}` between major sections for readability (only if space permits)

### Bullet Lists
- Place `\begin{itemize}...\end{itemize}` **outside** a `\lettercontent{}` block (see "Known template pitfall" above), wrapped in the matching Raleway-Medium `\fontspec` so the bullet font matches the body
- 3-5 bullets is ideal
- Start each bullet with bold label or action verb
- Use `\textbf{Label:}` for category-style bullets

### LaTeX Special Characters
- Underscore: `\_`
- Ampersand: `\&`

### Non-English Cover Letters
- Same template structure, just write content in the posting's language
- Adjust date format to local convention
- Adjust closing to local convention (e.g. "Med venlig hilsen," for Danish)
